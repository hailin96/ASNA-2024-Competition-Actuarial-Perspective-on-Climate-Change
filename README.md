"A Net Zero ASNA Springs: Cost-effective and
Sustainable Energy Planning for 2040 and beyond"

To ensure the sustainability of ASNA Springs’ solar photovoltaic and wind energy generation
infrastructure in the coming decade, “Climactuaries Co.” (subsequently referred to as Climactuaries)
analyzed both the historical and forecasted monthly average wind speed (meters per second),
temperature (Celsius), and solar GHI radiation (Watts per square meter) by examining their time series
models and ARIMA models, respectively.
Historical and forecasted solar photovoltaic power generation per month is projected using Climactuaries’
solar energy model, which is based on the following equation:

E = A x r x H x PR
Where E = Energy in kWh
A = Total area of panel (m^2)
r = Solar energy yield (%)
H = Monthly average solar radiation on panels (W/m^2)
PR = Performance ratio (%)

Similarly, historical and forecasted wind power generation per month is also projected using
Climactuaries’ model based on another equation:

P_turbine = (½) x p_air x A_blade x v_wind^3 x Cp
Where P_turbine is the power generated by the wind turbine (in Watts)
p_air is the air density (in kg/m^3)
A_blade is the swept area of the wind turbine blades (in m^2)
v_wind is the wind speed (in m/s)
Cp is the power coefficient, representing the efficiency of the wind turbine.

Assuming photovoltaic panels can be installed on the roofs of ASNA Springs’ residents’ detached homes,
and that wind power turbines are installed only on the empty land available, Climactuaries determined
both maximum and realistic power production capacities. Using different combinations of solar and wind
power, Climactuaries then determined the frequency of occurrence for each respective combination in the
historical energy mix.

While photovoltaic panels and wind turbines remain an expensive investment for the city at present,
Climactuaries’ financial model proposed an innovative solution to lower infrastructure costs by 1) selling
excess energy back to Canada’s grid system and 2) attaching a carbon price to fossil fuels. By comparing
the cost of sustainable energy with a presently cheaper energy source, such as fossil fuels, Climactuaries
was able to prove that, by attaching a price to every extra tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted, the
true financial cost of fossil fuels would be more expensive than renewable energy in the long-run.
Though there are many assumptions used in Climactuaries’ time series, energy projection and financial
models, the team of actuaries and environmental scientists believe that ASNA Springs will be able to fulfill
energy demand decades into the future with net zero energy, and ultimately remain as Canada’s climate
change leader.
